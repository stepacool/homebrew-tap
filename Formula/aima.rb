# Homebrew formula for the AIMA Labs CLI.
#
# This file belongs in a tap repo (e.g. github.com/aimalabs/homebrew-tap) so
# users can `brew install aimalabs/tap/aima`. It is kept here as the canonical
# source.
#
# Releasing a new version:
#   1. Publish the new version to PyPI (the Release workflow does this).
#   2. Bump `url` + `sha256` below to the new sdist (sha256 from PyPI's
#      "Download files" page, or `brew fetch`).
#   3. Regenerate the dependency `resource` blocks:
#        brew install brew-pip-audit  # one-time, optional
#        brew update-python-resources Formula/aima.rb
#   4. Open a PR against the tap repo; CI runs `brew test-bot`.
